MyHealthfinder API

 Challenges Faced
CORS & Fetching Issues:
Initially struggled to get API responses due to restrictions. Solved by ensuring the correct API parameters and choosing the right endpoints.

Data Formatting:
The API occasionally returns complex nested JSON. I wrote custom JavaScript to safely access the article titles and summaries.

Empty Results for Certain Filters:
To improve UX, I added fallback messages when no articles are found.
